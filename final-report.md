<h2 align="center"> Project Details </h2>

The **MyUni** project is *a complete university student and faculty management platform*. It is a unified, open-source solution designed to modernize and extend the current MyUoM app for Greek universities.  

During GSoC 2025, I worked on three repositories, all fully responsive and supporting both light and dark themes:

- **myuni-backend**
- **myuni-frontend-admin**
- **myuni-frontend-student**

### myuni-backend
The backend repository contains all server-side logic for both the student and admin portals. I implemented a robust authentication system, scalable backend architecture, and real-time data synchronization using modern technologies such as **Express.js, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, Redis, and Email services**.  

### myuni-frontend-admin
The admin portal enables administrators to manage academic information, announcements, and events. Admins can view and manage all users by role and easily control the CMS through a clean UI.  

### myuni-frontend-student
The student portal allows students to view their academic information, announcements, and events. Additionally, it provides a **drag-and-drop website builder** that empowers students to create personalized websites with minimal effort.

## Work Summary

### **1. Creating the Figma Designs**
At the initial stage, I designed layouts for **myuni-frontend-student** and **myuni-frontend-admin**. I focused on modern, accessible, and responsive designs for all devices.  

**Auth Pages**

**Student Portal Layout**

**Admin Portal Layout**

### **2. Developing Frontend for Student and Admin**
After finalizing designs and mentor feedback, I started developing the portals using **React (Vite) with TypeScript**, **ShadCN**, and **Tailwind CSS**. I followed best practices for reusability and structure.  

- **Error Boundary**: Initially, if one component broke, it crashed the whole app. I solved this by implementing error boundaries so that only the faulty component fails while the rest of the app continues working.  

---

### **3. Developing Backend for Student and Admin**
Once the frontend was functional, I moved to backend development. This was my first time working with an **OOP-based project template**, which was challenging at first but became a great learning experience thanks to my mentorsâ€™ guidance.  

The backend was built with **Express.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM**, with **Redis for caching**. I tested all APIs using Postman and successfully integrated them with the frontend.  

Additional backend work included:  
- **Implementing CI/CD pipelines**  
- **Building Docker images**  
- **Deploying on AWS EC2**  



## **Conclusion**
Overall, my work on the MyUni project during GSoC 2025 included **design, development, testing, deployment, and documentation**. I began with Figma designs, implemented both student and admin portals, built and optimized backend services, and ensured smooth integration across the system.  

This experience strengthened my technical expertise in full-stack development, DevOps practices, and collaborative open-source workflows. It also gave me a deeper understanding of designing scalable systems that can serve diverse institutions.  

Going forward, I plan to continue contributing to MyUni by:  
- Expanding features like analytics and advanced personalization.  
- Improving test coverage and documentation for easier onboarding.  
- Supporting other universities in adopting and customizing the platform.  
- Mentoring future contributors who wish to participate in GSoC.  

This journey has been a milestone in my open-source career, and I look forward to helping MyUni grow into a truly national platform for Greek universities.
